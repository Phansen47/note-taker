## User Story
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save button
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column

WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page

## Installation
You will need to have Express.js installed within the integrated terminal of VS Code.

## Usage
Launch the server.js application and navigate to the provided local host link in your browser. Here, you're able to create a new note by entering a title and the note's content. Once you're ready to save the note, click the save button, and it will be listed in the left-hand column of the interface. This process allows for the addition and management of multiple notes, including the options to clear out the note form or delete existing notes as needed.
